Hello,

I would like to identify card from XXX. You can get XXX traits on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_card_number#Issuer_identification_number_%28IIN%29).

If you want to solve this issue, check this [how-to guide]( https://github.com/d-edge/Cardidy/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#add-a-new-card).

Cheers,
